## ℹ️ About Linearity Curve for Mac

Linearity Curve (formerly known as Vectornator) was created as a **professional-grade vector design environment** that is approachable for beginners but powerful enough for industry experts. Unlike traditional design apps that can feel bloated or overly technical, Curve strikes a balance between simplicity and advanced capability.  

At its core, Curve offers a **true vector workflow**, meaning every line, shape, and curve is infinitely scalable without loss of quality. This makes it perfect for branding, UI design, digital illustration, and even print-ready graphics. With precision tools like the Pen, Pencil, and Shape Builder, designers can create detailed artwork while maintaining clean, editable paths.  

A key advantage of Curve is its **live, non-destructive editing**. Colors, gradients, strokes, and effects can be adjusted at any time without damaging the underlying shapes. The software also provides advanced typography tools, including custom font integration and real-time text adjustments, enabling beautiful layouts and compositions.  

Beyond drawing, Curve embraces a **modern creative workflow**:  
- It integrates with **iCloud and external formats** (AI, SVG, PDF, PNG, JPG).  
- Supports **multiple artboards** for flexible project management.  
- Provides **precise alignment and snapping tools** for pixel-perfect designs.  
- Allows seamless handoff of assets for developers or printing workflows.  

The **user interface** is clean, with an emphasis on canvas-first design. Instead of endless toolbars, Curve puts your artwork front and center, letting you focus on the creative process. Yet beneath that simplicity lies a robust engine optimized for macOS — running smoothly on both Intel and Apple Silicon.  

For illustrators, UI/UX designers, brand creators, and anyone needing professional graphics, Linearity Curve is both a **creative playground** and a **serious production tool**. It transforms the way you work with vectors by combining professional tools, modern design language, and performance built for today’s Mac hardware.
